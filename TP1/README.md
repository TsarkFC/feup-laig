## Project information

- (items describing main strong points)
- Scene
  - The created scene represents a Quidditch field from the Harry Potter saga.
  - It contains representations of all the primitives:
    - *Torus* - present in the field delimiting object and in the field hoops.
    - *Cylinder* - present in the hoop poles.
    - *Sphere* - present in the flag placed on the top of each tower.
    - *Triangle and Rectangle* - both present in the structure of each tower and on the tent placed outside of the field.
  - The scene also has different cameras pointing to objects that represent features that were not easy to observe on the main scene:
    - Scale factors.
    - Cylinder with basis of different sizes.
    - Cylinder texture coordinates.
