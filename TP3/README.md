## Project information

- All features implemented and working well.
- When the player selects a piece, the tiles to which he can move are highlighted.
- Implemented animations in the in game menus, game pieces and dragon caves. The game pieces are moved from point to point in an arc in the board, and the dragon caves spawn a dragon through a more complex animation. The menus animate in and out of the screen. The movement is also animated.
- Implemented menus with in-scene objects through the use of picking.
- Implemented in-game scene switching with 3 scenes to switch between.
- Undo is also well implemented in the interface, and when the game comes to an end, the game movie can be watched.
- Each player has 30 seconds to complete a move! If he doesn't complete it, it becomes the next player's turn.
- The amount of pieces eaten by each player are shown in the scoreboard.
- The game has 3 game moves, human vs human, human vs machine and machine vs machine. The modes with machines have 3 difficulties available to pick from.
- Scene
  - Three different scenes to pick from:
    - A magical flying carpet in a quidditch field.
    - A floating game board in the gravity of space, while enjoying the view of the earth.
    - A cosy room, with a simple wooden table and stools.
